{"question":"Question linked to image # 14 We see a 31-year-old man in the office. He comes accompanied by his mother, with whom he still lives, at the request of her. Two years ago he has not found a job and in recent months he has been retiring at home. The patient claims to feel tired and weak and therefore prefers to leave home little. The mother suspects that the patient is depressed and both admit that she may have gained weight, although it has not been heavy. In clinical examination, what most attracts our attention is a PA of 150\/100 mmHg and a prominent abdomen shown in the figure. In these circumstances, what do you think would be the most appropriate immediate behavior?\nA. All patient data are compatible with an excess of glucocorticoids. Discard for external questioning (oral, in creams) and, in addition to a standard analytical including lipid and glycemic study, would request several determinations of free cortisol in urine and a determination of plasma cortisol in the early morning, after administer oral dexamethasone the night before.\nB. The cutaneous stretch marks can be justified by a possible previous thinning. Most likely, the patient has a metabolic syndrome (obesity, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle ...). I would continue investigating this aspect (glycemia, lipids, confirmation of the TA, etc.). The possible depression could be reactive to the fact of not finding a job and for the moment I would remain expectant in this aspect.\nC. Cutaneous stretch marks are relatively nonspecific in an obese patient and high BP in a single determination does not allow any conclusions to be drawn. Apart from requesting a general analysis and continuing the study of a possible HTA, it would prioritize the depressive aspects of the patient's behavior and send it for a psychiatric evaluation.\nD. I would think about the possibility that the patient has a chronic liver disease with portal hypertension and ascites. Although it does not admit a high intake of alcohol, there are other causes (viral, etc.) that should be investigated. The HTA in a first visit may not be significant and, for now, the supposed depressive picture would leave it in the background.
